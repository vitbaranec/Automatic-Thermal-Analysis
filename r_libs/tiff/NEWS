NEWS/Changelog

0.1-5	2013-09-03
    o	bugfix: output of readTIFF(..., as.is=TRUE) with integer
	values was shifted by one (i.e., stored integer value x
	was returned as x + 1)

    o	writeTIFF() now supports 32-bit (integer) output

    o	writeTIFF() issues a warning if the input data range
	is outside [0, 1]

0.1-4	2013-02-19
    o	remove debugging output (it is now only shown if tiff
	is compiled with -DTIFF_DEBUG=1)

0.1-3	2012-11-05
    o	add support for 12-bit grayscale TIFF images in readTIFF()
	(Note that 12-bit TIFFs are outside of the standard, so
	we assume big-endian packing order)

    o	add readTIFF(..., as.is=TRUE) which preserves the integer
	values used in the TIFF as they are (if applicable) instead
	of rescaling to reals

0.1-2	2012-08-30
    o	fixed a bug in writeTIFF() for 16-bit images


0.1-1	2012-08-24
    o	add readTIFF(..., indexed=TRUE) which return indexed images as
	color map and an index matrix.

    o	fixed a bug in writing a TIFF file consisting of multiple
	subimages

    o	prevent TIFF from re-entering error calls


0.1-0	2012-08-04
    o	first CRAN release
